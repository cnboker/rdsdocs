# Steps to Connect Your Device to Bingo Cloud

Use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to burn the pre-compiled file alpine-rpi-latest-stable-aarch64.img.gz to an SD card.

Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi 4 device and power it on. During the initial startup of the device, there may be two restarts; please be patient.

If your network connection is functioning correctly, the screen will display a QR code after the system starts successfully. Please use your mobile phone to scan the QR code to activate the device.

After scanning the QR code, your mobile phone will navigate you to the Bingo Cloud system. If you have already registered an account on the Bingo Cloud system and have previously logged in with your mobile phone, the system will guide you to the device activation page, as shown in the image below:

If you already have an account but haven't logged in with your mobile phone, please log in with your mobile phone first and then rescan the QR code.

These are the detailed steps to connect your device to the Bingo Cloud. We wish you success in activating your device!
